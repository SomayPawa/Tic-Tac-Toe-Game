# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is my first front-end project. In this project I am using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT to build "Tic-Tac-Toe" Game.

I am using javascript tools such as 'setTimeout' to reset the state of the boxes in game. 
To run this project on chrome I am using 'live-server' extension readily available in Visual studio code.
